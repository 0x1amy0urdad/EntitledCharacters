# EntitledCharacters
Entitled Characters Mod Generator for Baldur's Gate 3, because all characters are entitled to have titles.

# Acknowledgements
The mod generator tool uses binaries downloaded from https://github.com/Norbyte/lslib. Huge thanks to Norbyte and other contributors for their enormous contribution to BG3 modding!

# Step-by-step guide: How to generate your own version of the mod

## Step 1
Download entitled_characters_modgen.exe from https://github.com/0x1amy0urdad/EntitledCharacters/releases/tag/1.0.0.2

## Step 2
Run it. I am not a UX expert, so UI is ugly, but it is functional. There is a long list of all titles, edit whatever you want, and then scroll all the way down. There is a button named "Generate EntitledCharacters pak".

## Step 3
Click the button. If this is the first time you run it, it will take about 3 to 5 minutes. It performs various initialization tasks, like downloading Lslib, building indexes of BG3 paks, etc.

## Step 4
Upon successful completion, it will show a message and open the location of the new pak in File Explorer.

If something went wrong, it will show a failure message. A log file "entitled_characters.log" will be created next to the executable that will contain more information about what went wrong.

## Step 5
Copy the pak file to your BG3 Mods folder. Usually it is located at "C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Mods". You can also use Laughing Leader's Mod Manager to install the new pak. You can download it from GitHub: https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager
